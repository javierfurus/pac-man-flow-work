# Pac-Man Flow

# What is this game?

A clone of Pac-Man in your terminal! It is called Log-Man, well... because he is brought to life by console.log( ), of course! 

Just play with:

```bash
npm start
```

# What else?

Well, you move with W, A, S and D. You can quit with Q. Also, you can set your difficulty! There is three of those:

- Easy, for the faint hearted
- Medium, for those who don't faint after drinking a shot of tequila
- Hard for the brave and silly.

That's it for now!

# Dependencies

This will probably run fine for most of you, however, for those having issues, this game uses 

```bash
node-aplay
```

so it will requires these packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install alsa-base alsa-utils
```

Also run:

```bash
npm install
```
